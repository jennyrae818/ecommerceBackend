## Description

This app allows a user who is owns or works for a company that sells/posts items to add, update and delete products from a database. There are also categories for the products as well as tags for the products that can also be added, updated and deleted. 


## Technologies
Requires npm and uses express, dotenv, sequelize, MySQL2 and Insomnia (or Postman)

## User-Guide
To get started, in your terminal, type in 'npm start'
<br>
<br>
You will then need to open your Insomnia app and run the posts, gets, puts and deletes from there. Here is a screenshot to show how I set mine up:
